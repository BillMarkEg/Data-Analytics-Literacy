  ## Combining and Shaping Data
  Janani Ravi
  ### Exploring tehniques to combine and shape data 
  #### combine and shape data using excel 
  <br> data- > load data -> data type detection -> based on entire data-set -> load if all is well || or  transaform-> use first row as header -> file menu -> close & load  
  #### to join them 
  <br> copy column header from sheet 1 to sheet 2 
  <br> do vlookup or index/match.
  <br> what is better ? 
  <br> 1 - the greatest benefit of using INDEX MATCH over VLOOKUP is the fact that,
  <br> with INDEX MATCH, you can insert columns in your table array without distorting your lookup results.
  <br> Any time you work with a large dataset,
  <br> there's a good chance you'll need to go back to edit our columns and potentially insert a new column
  <br> so using index match is more dynamic than manual lookup
  <br> 2- second : vlookup works only from right to left and on columns only but index/match is more dynamic.
  #### Labs 
  <br> Lab :  Playstore App Stats.xlsx -> joins  
  <br> Lab : Playstore App Stats.xlsx -> aggregations 
  #### Join using power quert 
  <br> get data -> merge -> select first table -> second table -> click id from each one -> select  join type.
  #### Labs  
  <br> Lab : check monthly sales sheet
  #### convert csv to table 
  <br> read csv -> save as xlsx
  <br> open sheet -> select all data in sheet -> insert menu -> table so wo now we created a table.  
  <br> NOTE : you now can selet 2 columns -> recommended charts -> do some visualizations 
  #### convert wide to long (hony production sheet) 
  <br> open sheet -> alt+ D + P -> click on (multiple consilidation range + pivot table ) -> select range : whole data you have  
  <br> then scroll down to last cell -> show details  -> Here you go long data. 
  #### create pivot table for summary stat
  <br> insert menu -> pivot table -> select range / table -> drag and drop to filter if you wanna filter on -> rows for data you wanna work on it -> facts you wanan make
  <br> Note : you can make agg on facts -> double click on its header and choose (avg/sum/count..) default is sum.
  <br> LAb : company finance sheet.
  ####  unpivot monthly sales  ->  result to "sales rep number sheet."
  <br> load file -> table 1  sheet ->  transform data -> sales rep column -> rclick <unpivot other columns > name it to : unpivot table -> close and load 
  <br> now we created new sheet from original one -> once change in original -> can refresh it by click  in unpivot table from queries and connection menu.
